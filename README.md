Random Forest with Wine Quality Data Set
========================================

Dataset is provided by UCI Machine Learning Laborary : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

- gradient_boosting_tree.py - Basic gradient boosting tree in Python via Sci-kit learn.
- extra_trees.py - Basic extra trees classifier usage in Python via Sci-kit learn.
- random_forest.py - Basic random forest usage in Python via Sci-kit learn, this does not yield 100% accuracy but mostly 95%.
- random_forest.r - Basic random forest usage in R, this yields 100% accuracy.
- random_forest_with_variable_training_set.r - This investigates the effect of accuracy by providing different number of training set per class to train.
- random_forest_with_variable_training_set_and_variable_trees.r - This investigates the effect of accuracy by providing different number of training set per class to train and variable number of trees in random forest.
